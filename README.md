# AFAS Virtual Reality foosball

![AFAS VRSoccer](https://github.com/AFASResearch/VRSoccer/blob/master/vrsoccer.png)

Play VR foosball with Google cardboard! A sample VR project to get started with cardboards & VR. 

* Use the hole in the cardboard to control the game with your finger. 
* You can even play foosball against others on this original AFAS foosball table.
* Double tap spawns another ball.
* Look at the rod to control the rod in the game.

This is intended as a sample project, it is not ready for any production usage :)
